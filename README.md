# smartware
C++ framework for smart devices based on light weight platform.

Smartware is designed to make software for light weight smart devices to be more maintainable, extensible and resuable. 
Complicated applications can be designed in an object oriented way with a compact subset of C++ features being leveraged, which is more intuitive and simpler than using native C and won't introduce big footprint or reduce system performance either.
