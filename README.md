# iotware
C++ framework for IoT devices.

Iotware is designed to make software for IoT devices to be more maintainable, extensible and resuable. 
Complicated applications can be designed in an object oriented way w ith a compact subset of C++ features being leveraged, which is more intuitive and simple comparing to native C and won't introduce big footprint or reduce system performance either.
